00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,345
Can I?

158
00:06:57,401 --> 00:06:58,471
Yes, Captain.

159
00:07:06,011 --> 00:07:07,437
- [TRAVIS EXHALES]
- [ELI] Hey, there.

160
00:07:07,535 --> 00:07:08,575
I thought I showered fast,

161
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,222
but you do the three-minute wash and go.

162
00:07:10,247 --> 00:07:12,959
[CHUCKLES] Yeah, sorry.
Don't want to be late.

163
00:07:12,984 --> 00:07:14,962
Got a huge meeting about
staffing department heads.

164
00:07:15,064 --> 00:07:17,791
Do you think after what happened
he's still gonna replace Ross?

165
00:07:17,816 --> 00:07:19,542
I honestly couldn't
say. It's complicated.

166
00:07:20,008 --> 00:07:23,245
Anyway, don't spend your
day off thinking about work.

167
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,514
Says the guy who'll be
at work thinking about you.

168
00:07:25,539 --> 00:07:27,645
- Mmm. I like that.
- Mmm.

169
00:07:29,799 --> 00:07:31,974
- See you tonight.
- Mmm. You will.

170
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,261
Be good.

171
00:07:43,506 --> 00:07:47,096
[EMPLOYEE 1] Look around you
and ground yourself in reality.

172
00:07:47,121 --> 00:07:49,241
- [EMPLOYEE 2] Oh, my gosh.
- [EMPLOYEE 1] I'm sorry.

173
00:07:50,366 --> 00:07:52,022
[EMPLOYEE 2] What are you even saying?

174
00:07:52,485 --> 00:07:54,828
[EMPLOYEE 1] Please.
Why are you doing this?

175
00:07:54,853 --> 00:07:56,946
[EMPLOYEE 2] Because you lied!

176
00:07:56,971 --> 00:07:58,858
- [KNOCKS ON DOOR]
- [EMPLOYEE 2] What?

177
00:07:58,883 --> 00:08:01,161
- We're closed.
- Okay. Seattle Fire.

178
00:08:01,186 --> 00:08:02,941
We, uh... We got a call
about a disturbance.

179
00:08:02,965 --> 00:08:04,666
Help us! She blocked all the exits.

180
00:08:04,691 --> 00:08:06,634
[EMPLOYEE 3] That stuff
she's holding, are explosives.

181
00:08:06,658 --> 00:08:07,817
She's a disgruntled employee.

182
00:08:07,842 --> 00:08:09,671
She's trying to blow this place up.

183
00:08:09,696 --> 00:08:12,121
[EMPLOYEE 2] Yeah, I was pretty
gruntled until you and Sanjay

184
00:08:12,146 --> 00:08:13,952
- lied to all of us gathered here.
- I'm gonna call PD.

185
00:08:13,977 --> 00:08:17,023
Yeah, we might need the bomb squad,
but I don't wanna spook her, so...

186
00:08:17,048 --> 00:08:19,095
I'll tell them no sirens and
to standby until we need them.

187
00:08:19,119 --> 00:08:20,267
Excuse me. Excuse me.

188
00:08:20,362 --> 00:08:22,192
I'm from the fire department.

189
00:08:22,597 --> 00:08:23,977
Okay, my name's Vic.

190
00:08:24,172 --> 00:08:26,102
- What's your name?
- [EMPLOYEE 2] Get lost, lady.

191
00:08:26,126 --> 00:08:28,690
- There's no fire here.
- Her name is Phyllis Myers.

192
00:08:28,715 --> 00:08:31,372
Okay, thank you. I'm-I'm
just here to talk, Phyllis.

193
00:08:31,555 --> 00:08:33,227
Can you tell me what
you have in your hand?

194
00:08:33,252 --> 00:08:34,770
It's antifreeze.

195
00:08:34,795 --> 00:08:37,353
[PHYLLIS] You are smarter
than everybody says, Kevin.

196
00:08:37,378 --> 00:08:39,760
So I guess you know that
when I mix it with this,

197
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:42,477
I get a wildly explosive compound.

198
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:45,465
- You wanna see me win the science fair?
- [ALL] Phyllis! [SCREAMING]

199
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:48,098
[VICTORIA] Phyllis. Hey, hey,
hey, talk to me. Talk to me.

200
00:08:48,123 --> 00:08:50,531
- [EMPLOYEE 4] She's gonna blow us all up!
- [VICTORIA] Talk to me.

201
00:08:50,742 --> 00:08:53,848
Your coworkers, they look pretty
scared, so why don't you just tell me?

202
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,652
Tell me why you're so upset.

203
00:08:58,466 --> 00:09:01,554
Because these dicks
stole my life's work!

204
00:09:10,244 --> 00:09:11,564
[JACK] Don't look too good, do I?

205
00:09:11,988 --> 00:09:13,404
Get out of my head, Jack.

206
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,236
[MAYA] Hey.

207
00:09:16,691 --> 00:09:18,507
I heard it went well.
That's positive.

208
00:09:20,283 --> 00:09:24,133
Yeah. If he would just
wake up. [INHALES DEEPLY]

209
00:09:24,158 --> 00:09:25,159
[MAYA] He will.

210
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,058
Can I say something as your friend?

211
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:29,625
Oh. [CHUCKLES] This ought to be good.

212
00:09:30,265 --> 00:09:33,089
It's natural to be stressed
in this situation.

213
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,813
First shift in charge. Jack...

214
00:09:36,258 --> 00:09:38,207
The last day and a half of chaos.

215
00:09:38,232 --> 00:09:41,442
Emotions can rise and
get the best of you.

216
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:43,703
- She's saying you can't cry.
- [ANDY] Hmm.

217
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,422
- I'm not gonna cry.
- [MAYA] It's not fair, I know.

218
00:09:46,447 --> 00:09:48,207
But as a woman in charge,
you have the weight

219
00:09:48,242 --> 00:09:50,659
of every woman in the
department on your shoulders.

220
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:53,415
That's what you said to
her when she was captain.

221
00:09:53,558 --> 00:09:56,942
It's different now. [STAMMERS]
We have a woman as chief.

222
00:09:56,967 --> 00:09:58,555
Yeah, but for how much longer?

223
00:09:59,597 --> 00:10:00,908
If Osman fires her,

224
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,887
a thousand bucks says he
appoints a good old boy,

225
00:10:02,912 --> 00:10:04,293
and we're back to the way it was.

226
00:10:04,318 --> 00:10:07,252
It's not enough to be
strong. You have to be tough.

227
00:10:07,504 --> 00:10:10,153
We don't have the luxury
of screwing up, not even once.

228
00:10:10,542 --> 00:10:12,475
Hate to admit it, but she's right.

229
00:10:12,641 --> 00:10:14,539
[MAYA] I'm just down
the hall if you need me.

230
00:10:16,057 --> 00:10:17,058
[ANDY] Thank you.

231

room 1197. Nurse Palmer, room 1... </i>

232
00:10:23,575 --> 00:10:25,887
I spent my whole life working in tech.

233
00:10:26,146 --> 00:10:27,872
And at every job I've had,

234
00:10:27,897 --> 00:10:31,226
douche-bags like this poach
my work and take the credit.

235
00:10:31,251 --> 00:10:33,229
[VICTORIA] Hey, Phyllis.
Phyllis, what do you do here?

236
00:10:33,253 --> 00:10:34,668
I'm a chemical engineer.

237
00:10:34,693 --> 00:10:36,341
Okay, cool. What do you engineer?

238
00:10:38,468 --> 00:10:42,127
We're developing a low-cost
technology to purify water.

239
00:10:42,152 --> 00:10:45,679
- Wow.
- Not everybody is as lucky as we are.

240
00:10:45,704 --> 00:10:47,345
A quarter of the world doesn't have

241
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:49,407
a reliable source of drinking water.

242
00:10:49,432 --> 00:10:51,780
Okay, and that's... Climate
change is making it worse,

243
00:10:51,961 --> 00:10:52,961
I'm guessing.

244
00:10:53,031 --> 00:10:55,275
- A-plus, Fyra Banks.
- Okay.

245
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,269
They said they would patent
the technology we developed,

246
00:10:58,488 --> 00:11:00,974
- but leave it open.
- We never said that.

247
00:11:00,999 --> 00:11:03,155
- Yes, you did, Sanjay!
- [EMPLOYEE 4] Shut up, Sanjay.

248
00:11:03,179 --> 00:11:05,075
You're gonna make
her spill that stuff.

249
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,366
- You mean this stuff?
- [VICTORIA] Uh... You know what?

250
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:09,060
Phyllis. Phyllis, what do you mean?

251
00:11:09,153 --> 00:11:11,266
What do you mean leave it open?

252
00:11:11,419 --> 00:11:14,476
[PHYLLIS] It means that anyone
can use it without paying for it,

253
00:11:14,501 --> 00:11:16,572
like people in underdeveloped countries.

254
00:11:16,597 --> 00:11:18,618
- [VICTORIA] Okay.
- But an hour ago,

255
00:11:18,643 --> 00:11:21,853
I find out that the patent is closed

256
00:11:21,878 --> 00:11:23,865
and that they filed it in their names,

257
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:25,685
so that they could get rich quick.

258
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,850
- Okay.
- Do you think I'm stupid?

259
00:11:28,032 --> 00:11:30,010
- Did you think I wouldn't find out?
- [VICTORIA] Phyllis...

260
00:11:30,034 --> 00:11:31,483
My partner's trying to de-escalate,

261
00:11:31,508 --> 00:11:33,717
but the subject has explosive chemicals.

262
00:11:33,742 --> 00:11:35,474
Sirens and lights
might cause her to act.

263

265
00:11:40,423 --> 00:11:42,218
All ground floor exits are locked.

266
00:11:43,709 --> 00:11:46,335
No exterior stairwells or access
to the higher floors either.

267
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:51,478
Phyllis, hey, you know what, I'm...
I'm... I'm so sorry that that happened.

268
00:11:51,581 --> 00:11:52,997
Nobody likes to be deceived.

269
00:11:53,022 --> 00:11:54,344
[SANJAY] Nobody deceived anybody...

270
00:11:54,368 --> 00:11:55,794
Sir, I am talking to Phyllis right now.

271
00:11:55,818 --> 00:11:57,578
[PHYLLIS] They just wanted to use me.

272

I have been working on cheap, scalable
water purification for 30 years.

273
00:12:03,405 --> 00:12:06,070
- You know, I'm glad somebody has been.
- He has too.

274
00:12:06,095 --> 00:12:07,176
- [VICTORIA] Okay.
- And him.

275
00:12:07,357 --> 00:12:10,364
And him. They lied to all of us.

276
00:12:10,573 --> 00:12:13,299
Why aren't you pissed
off about it, you sheep?

00:12:23,526 --> 00:12:25,911
It's lovely to see
you. Come in. Come in.

280
00:12:27,093 --> 00:12:28,094
Ooh.

all day. [LAUGHS]

283
00:12:32,811 --> 00:12:34,729
Actually, you just
missed some firefighters.

284
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,536
Although, you probably wouldn't
know them, they were Dick's age.

285
00:12:38,906 --> 00:12:39,941
- My mom made this.
- Oh!

286
00:12:39,966 --> 00:12:41,381
She's a better cook than I am.

287
00:12:41,406 --> 00:12:43,082
[LAUGHS] How sweet of her. Oh, okay.

288
00:12:43,107 --> 00:12:46,006
Well, why don't you, uh, set it
over there with the rest of the food?

289
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:48,630
And please help yourself to
a plate. There's so much.

290
00:12:49,036 --> 00:12:51,364
And I'm almost done with
the funeral director, okay?

291
00:12:53,367 --> 00:12:54,403
Okay.

292
00:12:54,428 --> 00:12:55,671
So as I was saying,

293
00:12:55,696 --> 00:12:57,594
<i>he was partial to Beethoven's Eroica,</i>

294
00:12:57,619 --> 00:13:00,375
and, um, the second
movement is a funeral march,

295
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,619
but I don't know, it's
just so bombastic, you know?

296
00:13:03,644 --> 00:13:05,715
Let's go with the
Mahler. It was his favorite.

297
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,130
Springsteen was his favorite.

298
00:13:12,239 --> 00:13:13,240
Hi.

might as well go over some paperwork.

You're supposed to be resting.

305
00:13:27,844 --> 00:13:29,576
I'm still the chief.
There's work to do,

[REPORTER 3] Can we get a statement?

00:36:30,222 --> 00:36:31,648
[MAYOR OSMAN] Hello,
ladies and gentlemen.

771
00:36:31,672 --> 00:36:34,420
To a city in mourning,
I am happy to report

772
00:36:34,727 --> 00:36:37,902
that Chief Natasha Ross has been
released to continue her recovery at home.

Are you still the fire chief, Ms. Ross?

775
00:36:42,256 --> 00:36:44,729
[MAYOR OSMAN] Chief Ross
has done excellent work.

776
00:36:44,833 --> 00:36:46,524
And the disclosure of a relationship

777
00:36:46,549 --> 00:36:48,620
that was against the rules
doesn't change that.

778
00:36:48,802 --> 00:36:52,254
It's the rule, not the
chief, that needs to be replaced.

779
00:36:52,279 --> 00:36:54,566
So, I've asked Chief Ross to stay on

780
00:36:54,591 --> 00:36:56,835
and, fortunately for
the city of Seattle,

781
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,570
- she has accepted.
- [REPORTER 3] Chief Ross,

782
00:36:58,595 --> 00:37:00,425
what do you think about that statement?

783

[REPORTER 4] Chief Ross, when
will you be back in office?

[REPORTER 5] How long has this

I'm sorry.

I fooled around with Kate.

What?

788
00:37:24,383 --> 00:37:27,628
At the ball, after we broke up.

00:37:27,965 --> 00:37:29,381

790

I didn't want you to hear it
from him or anybody else. I...

It was messed up, and I'm sorry.

Yeah, what? You want me to get all crazy

795

- I mean, I know but...
- But you know Dixon died that night?

797
00:37:52,176 --> 00:37:54,592
And so did the waitress, and
now her baby is all alone.

798
00:37:54,617 --> 00:37:57,285
And Jack has a traumatic brain
injury that he might not wake up from,

799
00:37:57,309 --> 00:37:58,562
and today, Phyllis is going to jail

800
00:37:58,586 --> 00:37:59,943
because I wasn't
able to talk her into

801
00:37:59,967 --> 00:38:01,745
- coming out of a building.
- You did talk her out.

802
00:38:02,324 --> 00:38:04,153
- All right.
- She was coming out

803
00:38:04,178 --> 00:38:06,156
and it would've been over if
that tech bro didn't pop off.

804
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,933
- Well, that's not enough.
- You saved her life.

805
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:10,232
And you almost lost
yours in the process.

806
00:38:13,069 --> 00:38:15,233
Crisis One is supposed to
be about stopping things

807
00:38:15,258 --> 00:38:16,800
before they get to that
point and I didn't.

808
00:38:17,704 --> 00:38:19,541
Now she and I have to live with that.

809

stuff, you and Kate hooking up?

- [SMACKS LIPS] Ah.

good political bet for now,

We fell in love in a war zone, and
we are addicted to the adrenaline.

Marriage is not about adrenaline.

trapped in that rubble,
